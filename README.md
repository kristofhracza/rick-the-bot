# Rick the bot
IP logging via Discord

## How does it work?
Once the target has opened the link *(where the project is deployed)* their IP will be used to determine some GEO location and device info.     
All this will be sent into a discord chat via a webhook, in the form of an embed.     

### Rick
Once the user has opened the link, they will be rick rolled.    
If the page is scraped by bots it will redirect them to a *no access page*.
